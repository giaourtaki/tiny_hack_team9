# The Challenge

**Duration:** 24 hours

Build a creative computer vision application using:
- **Focoos** platform for model training
- **ONNX** export format with quantization library
- **Arduino Nicla Vision** as deployment target
- **Zant** for flashing your model

**Use Case:** Any computer vision application - we'll reward your creativity! 🎨

# Some Food for Thought

As you build your solution, here are some aspects worth considering:

**On Data & Models**
- How did you choose your dataset? Edge AI has unique constraints that might influence what data works best
- Why did you pick that specific model architecture? Sometimes smaller is better... 😉
- Have you thought about the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency for your particular use case?

**On Performance & Deployment**
- Getting your model running on actual hardware is just the beginning - does it run fast enough for what you're trying to do?
- A surveillance system might need different framerates than a periodic quality checker
- What if some of the all computation didn't happen on the device? Pre-processing, post-processing, or complementary algorithms could live elsewhere

**On Integration & User Experience**
- The Nicla Vision can communicate with other systems - how reliable is your connection?
- Could you visualize your system's output in a way that anyone could understand, not just developers?
- Have you explored what other sensors the Nicla Vision has beyond the camera? IMU, microphone, environmental sensors...

**On Going Further**
- What if you ran more than one model? The hardware might surprise you with what it can handle
- Think about the full pipeline: what happens before and after your model runs?
- How would someone without technical knowledge interact with your system?
